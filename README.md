SpaceBrain-Forever
==================

This is a toy game I made with a friend, way back in early highschool. 
I litterally have much of this code written down in my trigenometry notes.
Like many things I did in highschool, this is entierly unfinished, and will
almost certainly never be finished. But it's a found memory, and I'll leave
it here as an archive.
